# Human guidance

<!-- VENDORED HEADER: START -->
Record the durable guidance Neil Voss states, or approves for preservation here, in his own words:
first person or close paraphrase, one to three lines per bullet. Material he supplies as a source
may inform [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) once it is settled, and an entry of uncertain
origin belongs there too. Rules: [REPO_STYLE.md](REPO_STYLE.md).
[PROPAGATED HEADER - ENTRIES BELOW ARE YOURS]
<!-- VENDORED HEADER: END -->

- Make durable changes in starter-repo-template; consumer copies are vendored.
- A temporary, easily removable wrapper is acceptable for the Graphify crash.
  Make the edited node count match the expected normalized count.
- Semantic links should attach spreadsheet actions to the original natural prose; ordinary numbered
  and nested list grouping should remain intact. Do not require every list item to begin with a bold
  action label.

- Use readme-docs and screenshot-docs to showcase the repository's finished tutorial and workbook
  outputs.

## Tutorial converter

- Prioritize DOCX and XLSX for importing into Google Docs and Google Sheets.
- Use LibreOffice to convert DOCX to PDF for useful output review; HTML preview is not needed.
- On this macOS host, run every command that can invoke LibreOffice outside the sandbox through
  the repository scripts; ODP imports may launch it indirectly for metafile conversion.
- Keep authoring easy for humans: use lists for tutorial instructions and GFM tables for the
  simple spreadsheet data.
- Keep the list-authored instructions and table-authored workbook in one Markdown file that
  produces all three outputs.
- Format spreadsheet formulas, cell IDs, menu choices, and bold list openings consistently.
  Enforce part, step, and substep numbering, and connect or check spreadsheet references.
- Examine djot-slide-builder and exam-formatting-tools for relevant patterns; the slide
  project's syntax guide does not directly apply to tutorial authoring.
- Migrate all three Fried Foods/babies tutorials, all five Microbes tutorials, and the three-part
  Dr Caffeine set. Include PETase in the inventory and identify its incomplete source material.
- Keep the workflow KISS and avoid speculative gates. Agents should resolve scientific migration
  issues with authoritative sources and document corrections.
- Use local DOCX/XLSX behavior checks and agent PDF visual assessment to determine completion.
  Google import is optional when access exists; claim it only with observed evidence.
- Complete milestones without waiting for human milestone signoff.
- Repair PETase with a clearly labeled synthetic Bradford dataset when original measurements
  cannot be recovered.
- Run the optional Google Sheets calculation check when access is available.
- Use the final layout `make_tutorial.py`, `tutorial_lib/`, `tutorial_data/`, and
  `tutorial_output/`; this supersedes the earlier distinct-prefix naming request.
- Apply the selected names consistently without old-name aliases or legacy compatibility stubs.
- Treat this as preproduction: fix the design, keep it KISS, and finish the work without legacy
  compatibility layers or stubs. Check the real student walkthrough and current artifacts before
  declaring completion.
- Compare every original lesson directly with its generated materials, walk through the actual
  generated XLSX as a student, and invite independent challenges. Preserve author voice; change the
  converter only for recurring design issues, and do not add validation infrastructure for this review.
- Preserve existing lesson prose unless a change has a clear, evidence-based reason; keep the author's
  voice.
- Babies and Microbes are established lessons; preserve their teaching experience and voice while
  correcting verified errors, typos, and format faults. Make as few wording changes as practical.
- Treat the Dr Caffeine materials as a draft foundation, not a quality benchmark. Complete all three
  parts as polished, independently usable classroom lessons, with efficient Enter once / Fill down work.
- Make the source-to-output workflow produce engaging, scientifically accurate, classroom-ready
  lessons while preserving author voice; do not claim learner outcomes without evidence.
- For the teaching-quality pass, use HCI cognitive-walkthrough methods and targeted humanizer edits;
  expert inspection does not count as student testing. Keep wording changes focused on actual learner
  needs and preserve the source voice.
- Keep numbering coherent across the three independently usable Caffeine lessons.
- In generated DOCX/PDF, use Regular PT Sans for body text, PT Sans Narrow for compact tables, and
  Roboto Mono for formulas/cells/menus. These are available in Google Docs. Keep Atkinson Hyperlegible
  Next out of this project because it is unavailable there.
- In generated DOCX, use Google Docs' Normal text, Title, Subtitle, and Heading 1-3 paragraph styles.
  Map Title to titles, Subtitle to optional metadata, Heading 1-3 to parts/steps/substeps, and Normal
  text to body/list/formula/quote/table text and the page footer. Use direct formatting for emphasis.
- Keep the GFM-to-DOCX/XLSX/PDF workflow easy to author: auto-style spreadsheet formulas from `=`
  in dark green without color markup, and make tutorial lists more compact. The older 4:55 samples
  feel less fun; preserve lesson voice and fonts, and keep student answer cells blank.
- Restore the original wording, descriptive headings, humor, and compact numbered groups across all
  tutorials. Change prose only for technical references, formulas, data, or genuine science errors;
  complete missing Caffeine content while preserving its good prose.
- I distrust LLM-written prose. Prefer existing authored content when it is available, and keep any
  humanizer edits restrained and grounded in the author's science and voice.
- Keep Roots in the course for now.
- Show the literal student source in fenced code blocks, and inspect rendered GFM documentation
  rather than assuming Markdown source will render correctly. I am concerned about the existing files.

## Student publishing

- Organize the student course as Parts, Steps, and Substeps. Use cropped visuals to emphasize the
  relevant part of a page, and refresh screenshots automatically after style changes.
- Let the course proceed without human milestone gates.

- BIOL318 tutorial authors should learn spreadsheet formulas, layout, and design; readers should
  learn statistics and how to construct spreadsheets.
- Keep source characters ASCII. Straight quotes and named entities are acceptable; numeric character
  references are unwanted.
- Preserve authored prose. Following a template is acceptable.
- Update references automatically when authors move columns or ranges or change data size.
- Give the compiler considerable visual freedom, including color and flair. My favorite palette
  includes dark reds, oranges, lime, green, teal, cyan, blue, purple, magenta, and pink; select
  colors purposefully.
- Give headings varied left indentation, with Step headings farther left than body paragraphs.
- Fully justify paragraphs that run longer than two lines.
- Use the README and current output screenshots to show off the pipeline's capabilities.
- Tutorial authors establish labels and worksheet structure first; they do not start with unlabeled
  colored areas. Tutorial users do not generally enter headings.
- I intentionally have no `.gitignore` rule for `__pycache__`, because it lets me know when agents
  are not following guidelines.
- I would consider adding a separate page showing how different syntax converts into formatting,
  using Markdown and cropped screenshots.
- Spreadsheet numerical formatting needs work; the default should be three decimal places.
- The formatting guide should explain how formulas and spreadsheet actions connect to workbook
  tables, with an example of adding a new row or column.
- Make the README landing page friendlier to non-coding students, with more about where to start
  and what to read.
