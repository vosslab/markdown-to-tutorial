## Tutorial

### Part: Calculate two predictors

- **Worksheet:** Sleep and scores

The worksheet supplies the headings and observations. You will calculate the two blank columns.

#### Step: Square the sleep hours

1. In cell C2, enter:
   [`=A2^2`](enter:C2)
2. [Fill C2:C5](fill:C2:C5) down to include all four observations.
3. Check that 6 hours gives 36 in C5.

#### Step: Compare with 7 hours

1. In cell D2, enter:
   [`=A2-7`](enter:D2)
2. [Fill D2:D5](fill:D2:D5) down to include all four observations.
3. Explain why the value in D5 is negative.
