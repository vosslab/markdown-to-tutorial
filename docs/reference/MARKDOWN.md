# Format the document

Use this page when you want to control the document your classmates read. The compiler formats
the structure. You write the scenario, explanations, questions, and instructions.

Return to [../AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](../AUTHORING_GUIDE.md) for the authoring path or
[../FORMATTING_GUIDE.md](../FORMATTING_GUIDE.md) for the visual index.

## Create Parts, Steps, and Substeps

Type this Markdown:

```markdown
### Part: Format the document

- **Worksheet:** Roots

#### Step: Organize instructions

1. Read the supplied column headings.
   - The measurements are in column A.
   - Column B is reserved for your calculations.
2. Keep your explanation beside the instruction it supports.

##### Substep: Add a detail

This paragraph belongs to the substep.
```

It becomes numbered Parts, Steps, and Substeps in the document. The `Worksheet` line tells the
compiler which sheet later actions use. The Roots values are only formatting data.

<!-- screenshots:end -->

Use `### Part:`, `#### Step:`, and `##### Substep:` exactly. The compiler supplies numbers.
Use ordinary paragraphs and lists for the rest of the instruction.

## Format scientific text

Type this Markdown:

```markdown
##### Explanation: Mark up scientific text

Use **bold** for emphasis, *italics* for a distinction, and `A2` for a literal cell address.
Scientific text can include &alpha;, H<sub>0</sub>, and mm<sup>2</sup>.

> A short note appears as a separate block.
```

It keeps the distinction between prose, literal spreadsheet text, scientific notation, and a note.

<!-- screenshots:begin (managed by screenshot-docs) -->
![Generated explanation with bold and italic text, a cell address, scientific notation, and a note block](../screenshots/authoring_text.webp)
<!-- screenshots:end -->

Use ASCII source: straight quotes and ordinary hyphens. Named entities such as `&alpha;` and
inline `sub`, `sup`, and `br` are supported. The compiler reports other raw HTML and numeric
character references.

## Add a document table

A table under `## Tutorial` belongs in the document, not in the workbook.

```markdown
#### Step: Show a document table

| Item | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Measurements | A2:A6 |
| Mean | E2 |
```

<!-- screenshots:begin (managed by screenshot-docs) -->
![Generated document table with Item and Location columns](../screenshots/authoring_table.webp)
<!-- screenshots:end -->

Use a Tutorial table for a comparison, decision aid, or written prompt. Use a Workbook table only
when the cells should appear in the student spreadsheet.

## Include images and links

Type this Markdown:

```markdown
#### Step: Include an image

![A normal curve with the area left of minus one shaded.](../../tutorial_data/assets/microbes_1_z_test_image2.png)

This image comes from the instructor's Microbes z-test tutorial.

#### Step: Link to a section

Return to the [instruction example](#step-organize-instructions).
```

The image appears in the document and its alternative text remains available. The section link
stays clickable in GitHub Markdown and generated output.

<!-- screenshots:begin (managed by screenshot-docs) -->
![Generated document with a normal-curve image and its surrounding instruction](../screenshots/authoring_image.webp)
![Generated document with a linked phrase referring to an earlier Step](../screenshots/authoring_links.webp)
<!-- screenshots:end -->

The image path above is relative to `docs/examples/authoring_features.md`; adjust it for your own
file location. Use a real relative image path in the source. Write alternative text that states what the image
shows. Ordinary links use relative paths inside this repository; use a heading fragment for a
section in the same file.

## Plan your own content

The following is an authoring outline, not runnable compiler syntax. Replace every angle-bracket
placeholder with your own content before building.

```text
### Part: <your Part title>

#### Step: <what the reader does>

<setup paragraph>

1. <student instruction>

##### Explanation: <why this matters>

<interpretation>
```

The compiler standardizes the formatting. It cannot decide whether a scenario, explanation, or
question is scientifically appropriate. See [../TUTORIAL_SPEC.md](../TUTORIAL_SPEC.md) for the
complete supported source contract.
