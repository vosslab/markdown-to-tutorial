# Dr. Caffeine's All-Nighter Academy: descriptive statistics

This is tutorial 1 of 3. No previous tutorial is required. The workbook contains all 25 observations from the [original class template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhOQhC_1hqnbvYItPT3y-V-_9l9q3pN7MtZDcOevaA0/edit?gid=0#gid=0); formula answers are blank. Record your written responses in D6:F8 or in accompanying notes.

## Tutorial

### Part: **Warm up - Tania + Roohana**

Welcome to **All-Nighter Academy Orientation**! Before we investigate whether sleep can predict exam performance, let&#8217;s warm up with some basic statistics using Google Sheets! In this section, you'll learn how to enter data and calculate the average amount of sleep students get using mean, median, and sample standard deviation using our dataset, and summarize their exam scores too. These calculations will help us understand the data before moving on to the rest of the analysis.

#### Step: **Set Up Your Google Sheet**

Before we begin calculating statistics, we need to create a personal workspace where we can organize, analyze and interpret our data. Throughout this tutorial, you will be using Google Sheets to perform calculations and create visualizations.

1. Open this tutorial's generated XLSX workbook in Google Sheets, containing the template data created by your favorite grad students.\
2. Make a personal copy of the Google Sheet by going under **File** and &#8220;**Make a Copy**&#8221;\
3. Rename your spreadsheet with your name and the date. For example: **Name_AllNighterAcademy_102126**\
4. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Google Sheet layout. Use the **Sleep and scores** tab throughout this activity; the data are in A1:B26, and each row is one student.\
5. Make sure you can view the column containing the **Hours of Sleep** and **Exam Score** data. These variables will be the focus of our analysis through this tutorial.

Once your Google Sheet is set up, you&#8217;re ready to begin exploring the data.

#### Step: **Calculate the Basics**

Before we examine whether sleep is related to exam performance, let&#8217;s summarize the data using descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics helps us understand the typical values in a dataset and how much those values vary from one student to another

For this activity, we will calculate the average amount of sleep students get, as well as summarize exam performance using the **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation**.

Tasks: Perform the following calculations using spreadsheet functions. Type labels as ordinary text; enter formulas beginning with = and press Enter. Keep paired observations together, and record written responses in your notes.

Label D1 [Statistic](label:D1), E1 [Hours of sleep](label:E1), and F1 [Exam score (%)](label:F1).

Let's start by examining the amount of sleep students are getting in our dataset.

* **Mean** (Average Sleep) tells us the typical amount of sleep students get: Use the formula [=AVERAGE(A2:A26)](enter:E2) in E2 to find the mean hours of sleep. This will give you the average sleep duration, providing an overall measure of central tendency.\
  * **Average Hours of Sleep = _____ hours**

Label D2 [Mean](label:D2). For exam scores, enter [=AVERAGE(B2:B26)](enter:F2) in F2. Record the corresponding exam-score statistic; its unit is %.

Based on your result, do students appear to be getting enough sleep? Is the average higher or lower than you expected?

Unlike the mean, the median is less affected by unusually high or low scores. This makes it useful when a dataset contains potential outliers.

* **Median** (middle value) helps identify the center of the distribution and is less affected by unusually high or low scores: Use the formula [=MEDIAN(A2:A26)](enter:E3) in E3 to find the median sleep duration.\
  * **Median Sleep = _____ hours**

Label D3 [Median](label:D3). For exam scores, enter [=MEDIAN(B2:B26)](enter:F3) in F3. Record the corresponding exam-score statistic; its unit is %.

Is the median similar to your mean?

While measures of center tell us what a typical sleep duration looks like, they do not tell us how much students differ from one another.

* **Standard Deviation** (spread of data): This measures how spread out the sleep durations are from the mean, indicating the variability of student sleep. Use the formula [=STDEV.S(A2:A26)](enter:E4) in E4 to calculate the standard deviation.\
  * **Standard Deviation of Sleep = _____ hours**

Label D4 [Sample standard deviation](label:D4). For exam scores, enter [=STDEV.S(B2:B26)](enter:F4) in F4. Record the corresponding exam-score statistic; its unit is percentage points.

A small standard deviation indicates that the sleep durations are clustered closely around the average. A large standard deviation shows that the sleep durations vary substantially from student to student.

Write two sentences for Dr. Caffeine: one about typical sleep and its variability, and one about typical exam performance and its variability. Include the six calculated values and their units. Keep the formulas in your workbook for submission.

Congratulations! You are now ready for your first day at All-Nighter Academy. You have successfully used Google Sheets to calculate descriptive statistics. Next, we&#8217;ll use a set of data to investigate whether hours of sleep can predict final exam scores.
