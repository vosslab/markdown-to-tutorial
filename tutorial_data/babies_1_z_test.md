# **"Joe's Hospital of Fried Foods" vs. National Average**

**Z-Test Tutorial for BIOL 318/418**

![][image1]

A **Z-test** is a statistical test used when you want to know if the average of your sample is
meaningfully different from a known population mean. It works by comparing the sample mean to the
population mean, while taking into account the population's standard deviation and the size of the
sample. The result is a Z test statistic, which tells you how many standard errors away your sample
mean is from the population mean. If this distance is big enough (based on probability cutoffs
called p-values), you can reject the idea that your sample is "just like" the population. A z-test
requires a genuinely known population standard deviation and a normally distributed sample mean.
With a small independent sample, this needs an approximately normal birth-weight population; a large
sample can justify an approximation. There is no automatic cutoff at 30.

## Tutorial

### Part: Scenario

- **Worksheet:** Part 1 National Z-Test

"*Joe's Hospital of Fried Foods*" claims that their babies are larger than the national average. For
this fictional teaching scenario, assume a national average newborn weight of 7.5 lbs and a known
population standard deviation of 1.5 lbs. In this tutorial, you'll use Google Sheets to conduct a
z-test using the sample data provided.

For the right-tailed claim, H0: the hospital population mean is at most 7.5 lbs; H1: it is greater
than 7.5 lbs. The test is calculated at the null boundary of 7.5 lbs.

For the two-tailed comparison, H0: the hospital population mean equals 7.5 lbs; H1: it differs from
7.5 lbs. Choose the alternative before examining results. A hospital comparison does not establish
that fried foods cause a change in birth weight.

#### Step: Set Up Your Google Sheet

1. Open the generated student XLSX in Google Sheets. This workbook contains the data sheet and the
   **"Part 1 National Z-Test"** working sheet. The original combined instructor template also had a
   Part 2 tab; that tutorial now has its own workbook.
2. Make a personal copy of the workbook by going under **File** and "**Make a Copy**".
3. Change the name of the spreadsheet by adding your name and perhaps the date.
4. Copy the data table from **"Datas for Part 1 and 2"** and paste it into **"Part 1 National
   Z-Test"** to practice the original workflow or reset your practice edits. The working sheet
   already contains the same 24 observations.
5. The original instructor template is available here: [Original instructor Google
  Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A3hMTmSyL8Z-8v2K7Zit27SYXdgzQ7fHGqxqR7kCAPU/edit).
   It has no verified tab mapping; use the generated workbook for this tutorial.

There are 24 supplied weights in rows 2-25. The formulas deliberately include
blank rows through row 40 so you can extend the data in the practice task.

#### Step: Set Up the Known Population Values

**Population parameter**: A population parameter describes the entire group of interest, meaning
every individual in the group you want to study, such as all babies born in the United States.

1. Working in the tab **"Part 1 National Z-Test"**
2. **Columns D and E:** Set aside these columns for statistical calculations.
3. In cell **D1**, it should say "**Statistical Names**".
4. In cell **E1**, it should say "**Statistical Values**".
5. In cell **D2**, it should say [Population Mean](label:D2).
6. In cell **E2**, enter [7.5](enter:E2).
   - ^ this is our representative mean baby weight of the population
7. In cell **D3**, it should say [Population St.Dev.](label:D3).
8. In cell **E3**, enter [1.5](enter:E3).
   - ^ this is our representative baby weight standard deviation of the population
9. After these entries, your table should contain the values above; its column headings are already
   supplied.

#### Step: Calculate the Sample Values

**Sample statistic**: A sample statistic describes a smaller subset drawn from that population, such
as a group of babies born at one hospital which is a subset of all babies born in the United States.

1. In cell **D5**, it should say ["Sample Size"](label:D5).
2. In cell **E5**, we will use the `COUNT` function to dynamically count the number of weights:
   - Enter: [=COUNT(B2:B40)](enter:E5)
   - This formula counts the weights from cells B2 to B40, allowing for flexibility if you add more
     data. It will automatically ignore empty cells.
3. In cell **D6**, it should say ["Sample Mean"](label:D6).
4. In cell **E6**, use the `AVERAGE` function to calculate the sample mean:
   - Enter: [=AVERAGE(B2:B40)](enter:E6)
   - This formula calculates the mean of weights from cells B2 to B40, allowing for flexibility if you
     add more data. It will automatically ignore empty cells.
5. In cell **D7**, it should say ["Sample St.Dev."](label:D7).
6. In cell **E7**, use the `STDEV.S` function to calculate the sample standard deviation:
   - Enter: [=STDEV.S(B2:B40)](enter:E7)
   - This formula calculates the standard deviation of weights from cells B2 to B40, allowing for
     flexibility if you add more data. It will automatically ignore empty cells.
   - We will not be using the sample standard deviation for this statistical test.

#### Step: Calculate the Z Test Statistic

1. In cell **D9**, it should say ["Z Test Statistic"](label:D9).
2. In cell **E9**, calculate the Z test statistic using the formula:
   - Formula: (sample mean - population mean) / [ population standard deviation / sqrt(sample size) ]
   - Enter: [=(E6 - E2) / (E3 / SQRT(E5))](enter:E9)
   - This formula uses the sample mean (E6), population mean (E2), population standard deviation
     (E3), and sample size (E5). The use of `SQRT(E5)` adjusts for varying sample sizes.

   **Note:** In a Z-test, the calculated value is called the Z test statistic, not a simple z-score.
   A z-score measures how far one data point is from the mean, while the Z test statistic measures
   how far the sample mean is from the population mean. Both use the same standardized scale, which
   is why they look alike but apply to different situations.

#### Step: Determine the Type of Test (One-Tailed or Two-Tailed) and Calculate the P-Value

When running a hypothesis test, you need to decide whether you care about differences in one
direction or both. A one-tailed test looks only for an effect in a single direction (for example,
asking if a group is larger than another), while a two-tailed test checks for any difference in
either direction (larger or smaller). This choice depends entirely on how you frame your research
question.

##### Substep: Understand the Research Question

1. Joe's claim is that his hospital's mean is greater than the national average, so the
  assigned test is right-tailed. Record that alternative before calculating or comparing either
  p-value. The two-tailed result is included for comparison, not as a second chance to find a
  significant result.
2. **One-Tailed Test:** Use this if testing whether babies at the hospital are **larger** than the
  national average.
3. **Two-Tailed Test:** Use this if testing for **any difference** (either larger or smaller) in baby
  weights.

##### Substep: Calculate the P-Value Based on the Chosen Test

1. **Two-Tailed Test:**
   - In cell **D11**, it should say ["P-Value (Two-Tailed)"](label:D11).
   - In cell **E11**, enter [=2 * (1 - NORM.DIST(ABS(E9), 0, 1, TRUE))](enter:E11).
2. **One-Tailed Test:**
   - In cell **D12**, it should say ["P-Value (One-Tailed, Right Tail)"](label:D12).
   - In cell **E12**, enter [=1 - NORM.DIST(E9, 0, 1, TRUE)](enter:E12).

`NORM.DIST(z, 0, 1, TRUE)` gives the standard normal cumulative probability: **0** sets the mean,
**1** sets the standard deviation, and **TRUE** selects cumulative probability. For your Z statistic,
it tells you
the probability of seeing a value less than or equal to that number under the bell-shaped curve of
the standard normal distribution (mean \= 0, standard deviation \= 1). This is what allows us to
turn a test statistic into a p-value.

Both p-values and decisions are calculated so you can compare the two approaches. Use only the
right-tailed test chosen from Joe's claim when reporting the result; do not choose between the tests
based on which p-value is smaller.

#### Step: Make a Decision Using an IF Statement

1. In cell **D14**, it should say ["Significance Level (&alpha;)."](label:D14).
2. In cell **E14**, enter [0.05](enter:E14).
3. In cell **D16**, it should say ["*Two-Tail Decision*."](label:D16).
4. In cell **E16**, use the **IF** statement to automatically determine whether to reject the null
   hypothesis:
   - Using the **two-tailed test** p-value (in **E11**), enter the formula:
     [=IF(E11 <= E14, "Reject the Null Hypothesis", "Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis")](enter:E16).
5. In cell **D17**, it should say ["*One-Tail Decision*."](label:D17).
6. In cell **E17**, use the **IF** statement to automatically determine whether to reject the null
   hypothesis:
   - Using the **one-tailed test** p-value (in **E12**), enter the formula:
     [=IF(E12 <= E14, "Reject the Null Hypothesis", "Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis")](enter:E17).
7. Explanation:
   - The **IF** statement checks if the p-value (from either E11 or E12) is **less than or equal to**
     the significance level (in **E14**).
   - If the condition is true (p-value &le; 0.05), it returns "Reject the Null Hypothesis."
   - If the condition is false (p-value > 0.05), it returns "Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis."

#### Step: Interpret the Results

1. In cell **D19**, it should say ["Interpretation"](label:D19).
2. In cell **E19**, write a brief interpretation of your findings based on your chosen test:
   - **Two-Tailed Test Example:** "With a p-value of \[calculated value\], we \[reject/fail to
      reject\] the null hypothesis, indicating that the average weight at 'Joe's Hospital of Fried
      Foods' \[is/is not\] significantly **different** from the national average."
   - **One-Tailed Test Example:** "With a p-value of \[calculated value\], we \[reject/fail to
      reject\] the null hypothesis, indicating that the average weight at 'Joe's Hospital of Fried
      Foods' \[is/is not\] significantly **greater than** the national average."

#### Practice Task:

* Add more baby weights to Column B (up to row B40) to see how the sample size
  impacts the **Z test statistic** and **p-value**.
* Modify some of the existing baby weight values to higher or lower numbers and
  observe how the **sample mean**, **Z test statistic**, and **p-value** in Column E adjust
  automatically.
* Discuss how changing the dataset size or individual baby weights affects the
  hypothesis test results and your interpretation.

#### Key Takeaways:

1. **Flexibility:** By using a flexible range (B2:B40), this setup allows you to vary the number of
   babies and observe how it influences statistical outcomes.
2. **Z Test Statistics:** Standardizing the sample mean by its standard error helps compare it to a
   known population mean. A z-test requires known population SD; there is no magic n=30 cutoff.
3. **Dynamic Calculations:** Google Sheets automatically recalculates the Z test statistic and
   p-value as you add or modify data, showing real-time effects on hypothesis testing.

### Setup for the T-Test:

Joe was ecstatic after conducting his Z-test, certain that his hospital's babies were the heaviest
in town. He was ready to claim the Baby Butter Ball Award and throw a butter-and-bacon-themed
celebration. The sample mean was higher, but the right-tailed test was not statistically significant.

But just as Joe began planning his victory speech, the award committee sent him a stern letter:

"Joe, we've reviewed your analysis. While you compared your babies' weights to the national average
using a Z-test, you assumed the population standard deviation was known. That's risky, given the
variation in hospital practices and diets. The population standard deviation is not known, and
estimating it from this sample calls for a T-test. A sample smaller than 30 does not automatically
invalidate a Z-test, but the sample's distribution and assumptions also matter. Until you redo the
analysis properly, you're disqualified from the Baby Butter Ball Award."

![][image10]

Joe's heart sank. As the news spread, protesters gathered outside the hospital. Some were angry with
Joe, holding signs that read "You Should Know Better" and "Joe is a Fraud." Others blamed the Butter
Ball Committee, with signs like "We Were Cheated" and "The T-Test Was Created by Only a Student\!"

Joe stood in disbelief, watching the chaos unfold. His hopes for the Baby Butter Ball Award were
slipping away.
